# Velpa

Velpa is a mobile application that I developped from just the idea of connecting people who want to go hikking with local guides

Velpa is a mobile aplication for connecting people who wants to go into an adventure and local guides who know the route.

#### Development

For development, you may want to use a [virtual environment](https://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) to avoid dependency conflicts between pyfolio and other Python projects you have. To get set up with a virtual env, run:
```bash
mkvirtualenv pyfolio
```

Next, clone this git repository and run `python setup.py develop`
and edit the library files directly.

#### Matplotlib on OSX

If you are on OSX and using a non-framework build of Python, you may need to set your backend:
``` bash
echo "backend: TkAgg" > ~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc
```

## Usage

A good way to get started is to run the pyfolio examples in
a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/). To do this, you first want to
start a Jupyter notebook server:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

From the notebook list page, navigate to the pyfolio examples directory
and open a notebook. Execute the code in a notebook cell by clicking on it
and hitting Shift+Enter.
